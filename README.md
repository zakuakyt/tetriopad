## 1. schematic
this was my first time using kicad so I spent a bit more time on this but picked it up pretty quickly. I decided to add 2 RGB LEDs in addition to the keys - one that shines each time the spacebar is pressed, and one that just turns on when the board is plugged in.

## 2. routing
Using the hackpad tutorial, I routed all the components, using frontside and backside. I also added an image and some other random stuff to the silkscreen to make it cooler.

## 3. cad
I made a simple case for the board with some screw holes, a gap for the rp2040, and some nice beveled sides. I have some prior experience with fusion so this step was not too difficult.
